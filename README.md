# Credit-Default-Prediction
The goal of this project is to predict credit default based on various features using machine learning. The task involves classifying whether a customer is likely to default on credit payment in the next month or not.

# Project Title: Credit Default Prediction

## Step 1: Framing the Problem
The goal of this project is to predict credit default based on various features using machine learning. The task involves classifying whether a customer is likely to default on credit payment in the next month or not.

## Step 2: Collecting the Raw Data for the Problem
The raw data for this project is sourced from the 'Credit_default_dataset.csv' file, which contains information about customers' credit-related attributes.

## Step 3: Processing the Data to Analyze
Data processing steps include loading the dataset using Pandas, dropping unnecessary columns (e.g., 'ID'), and mapping categorical variables to appropriate numerical values.

## Step 4: Exploring the Data
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) involves examining the dataset to gain insights. This includes checking the first few rows of the dataset, renaming columns, and handling categorical variables.

## Step 5: Performing In-depth Analysis
The analysis involves the use of XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm, for credit default prediction. Hyperparameter optimization is conducted using RandomizedSearchCV to find the best set of hyperparameters for the model.

## Step 6: Communicating Results of this Analysis
Results are communicated through the README file, including the best hyperparameters found during the optimization process, and the mean cross-validation score.

## Step 7: Yields Better Result and Increases Productivity
Implementing the machine learning model with optimized hyperparameters is expected to yield better predictive performance. The use of RandomizedSearchCV helps to efficiently search through hyperparameter space, improving the model's accuracy. This contributes to increased productivity by automating the hyperparameter tuning process.
